# 46. Difference Between SQL and NoSQL Databases

### SQL Databases
- **Structured Data**: Stores data in tables with fixed schemas.
- **ACID Compliance**: Ensures data reliability.
- **Scalability**: Vertical scaling (adding resources to a single server).
- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle DB.
- **Use Case**: Banking systems, e-commerce platforms, and applications requiring complex queries.

### NoSQL Databases
- **Flexible Schema**: Stores unstructured or semi-structured data.
- **Eventual Consistency**: Prioritizes scalability over strict consistency.
- **Scalability**: Horizontal scaling (adding more servers).
- **Examples**: MongoDB (document), Cassandra (column), Redis (key-value).
- **Use Case**: Real-time analytics, IoT applications, social networks.

# 47. Normalization and Its Types

### What is Normalization?
Normalization is a database design process that organizes data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

### Types of Normalization
1. **1NF (First Normal Form)**: Removes duplicate columns and ensures atomic values.
2. **2NF (Second Normal Form)**: Removes subsets of data that depend on part of a primary key.
3. **3NF (Third Normal Form)**: Ensures no transitive dependency (non-primary key depends on another non-primary key).
4. **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**: Stronger version of 3NF, ensuring every determinant is a candidate key.

# 48. Index in a Database

### What is an Index?
An index is a data structure that improves query performance by enabling faster data retrieval.

### How It Works
Indexes create a lookup table that points to the location of data.

### Example
<pre>
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);
</pre>

### Benefits
- Faster SELECT queries.
- Improved search performance.

### Limitations
- Slower INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations.
- Increased storage requirements.

# 49. ACID in Databases

### What is ACID?
ACID stands for:
1. **Atomicity**: Ensures a transaction is fully completed or not executed at all.
2. **Consistency**: Ensures the database remains in a valid state after a transaction.
3. **Isolation**: Transactions are executed independently.
4. **Durability**: Changes from a committed transaction are permanently saved.

### Example
Banking systems require ACID compliance to ensure accurate transfers between accounts.

# 50. Difference Between JOINs in SQL

### Types of JOINs
1. **INNER JOIN**: Returns rows that have matching values in both tables.
   <pre>
   SELECT * FROM employees e INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
   </pre>

2. **LEFT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. Fills unmatched rows with NULL.
   <pre>
   SELECT * FROM employees e LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
   </pre>

3. **RIGHT JOIN**: Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table. Fills unmatched rows with NULL.
   <pre>
   SELECT * FROM employees e RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
   </pre>

4. **OUTER JOIN**: Returns all rows from both tables, filling unmatched rows with NULL.
   <pre>
   SELECT * FROM employees e FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
   </pre>

### Use Cases
- **INNER JOIN**: When you need only matching records (e.g., finding employees in specific departments).
- **LEFT/RIGHT JOIN**: When you want all records from one table and matching records from another (e.g., finding all employees regardless of department assignment).
- **OUTER JOIN**: When you need all records from both tables (e.g., finding employees without departments and departments without employees).





# 46. Difference Between SQL and NoSQL Databases

### SQL Databases
- **Structure**: Relational, table-based schema with predefined structure.
- **Query Language**: Use SQL for data manipulation.
- **Scalability**: Vertically scalable (add resources to a single server).
- **Examples**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle.
- **Use Case**: Banking systems, e-commerce, applications with complex queries.

### NoSQL Databases
- **Structure**: Non-relational, supports document, key-value, graph, or columnar models.
- **Query Language**: Varies by database (e.g., JSON-based for document databases).
- **Scalability**: Horizontally scalable (add more servers).
- **Examples**: MongoDB (document), Cassandra (column), Redis (key-value).
- **Use Case**: Real-time analytics, IoT applications, content management systems.

# 47. Normalization and Its Types

### What is Normalization?
Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity.

### Types of Normalization
1. **1NF (First Normal Form)**:
   - Ensure all attributes contain atomic values.
   - Remove duplicate columns.

2. **2NF (Second Normal Form)**:
   - Remove partial dependency (non-prime attributes depend on part of a composite key).

3. **3NF (Third Normal Form)**:
   - Remove transitive dependency (non-prime attributes depend on other non-prime attributes).

4. **BCNF (Boyce-Codd Normal Form)**:
   - A stricter version of 3NF; every determinant must be a candidate key.

# 48. Index in a Database

### What is an Index?
An index is a data structure that improves the speed of data retrieval operations on a database table.

### How It Improves Performance
- Creates a lookup table to quickly find the row corresponding to a key value.
- Reduces the time complexity for search operations from O(n) to O(log n).

### Example
<pre>
CREATE INDEX idx_name ON employees(name);
</pre>

### Limitations
- Slower write operations due to the need to update the index.
- Increased storage requirements.

# 49. ACID in Databases

### What is ACID?
ACID stands for:
1. **Atomicity**: Transactions are all-or-nothing.
2. **Consistency**: Database remains in a valid state after a transaction.
3. **Isolation**: Transactions do not interfere with each other.
4. **Durability**: Committed transactions are permanently saved.

### Example
In a banking system, transferring funds between accounts ensures the amount is deducted and added atomically and consistently.

# 50. Difference Between JOINs in SQL

### Types of JOINs
1. **INNER JOIN**:
   - Returns rows with matching values in both tables.
   <pre>
   SELECT * FROM employees e INNER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
   </pre>

2. **LEFT JOIN**:
   - Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table; unmatched rows are filled with NULL.
   <pre>
   SELECT * FROM employees e LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
   </pre>

3. **RIGHT JOIN**:
   - Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left table; unmatched rows are filled with NULL.
   <pre>
   SELECT * FROM employees e RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
   </pre>

4. **FULL OUTER JOIN**:
   - Returns all rows from both tables; unmatched rows are filled with NULL.
   <pre>
   SELECT * FROM employees e FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
   </pre>

### Use Cases
- **INNER JOIN**: For retrieving only matching records (e.g., finding employees in specific departments).
- **LEFT JOIN**: For including all records from one table and matching ones from another (e.g., employees with or without departments).
- **FULL OUTER JOIN**: To find all rows, including unmatched records (e.g., employees without departments and vice versa).
